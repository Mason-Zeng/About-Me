        <h1>Hi! I am Mason Zeng</h1>
        <article id = "about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Mason Zeng, and I am a 2nd year student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. 
                I am from Brooklyn, New York, just a few hours south of a drive from Rochester. Here's a brief
                overview and timeline of my life. I grew up as an average kid going to public school starting 
                from pre-school all the way to high school. I considered myself to be a “goody-two-shoes” as I 
                always was following the rules and maintained high grades. However, I was very quiet and reserved 
                and all I really liked to do during my middle school and early high school days was to play video games 
                and nothing else. Looking back, the harm was not worth the “fun” as I quickly detached from my surroundings 
                and essentially had no social skills. I am very thankful that I was able to find a group of people in my church 
                that helped me to be more verbal and overall opened my eyes to the world. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that I am in college, I have even more opportunities to improve myself. College is the steppingstone to living 
                independently where all the choices are up to the individual. Here I hope to learn how to live independently while 
                also diving even deeper into my interests. For example, finding another Christian fellowship to better my faith, taking 
                SWEN courses to better my knowledge in software engineering, and playing open gym volleyball to better my skills in volleyball.

            <h2>My Hometown</h2>
            <p>
                I am from Brooklyn NY, one of the 5 boroughs in New York City. One thing I really like about Brooklyn is its variety of activities. 
                Since it's located in the city, there are many good restaurants and sources of entertainment such as parks, museums, shops, culture 
                towns, and so much more. Additionally, the public transportation system is very convenient as it can take you all around the city. 
                Not only do I have access to Brooklyn activities but also activities within Manhattan, Queens, and the Bronx. However, there are some 
                negatives. The city is very dangerous and has many crazy people. The crime rate is very high to the point where New York City is known 
                throughout social media for its stereotypical uncouth behavior.

                I am a Software Engineering BS major at RIT of 2027. I hope to better my skills in programming and software processes so that I can hopefully

            <h2>My Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <p>
                For my interests, I am a devout Protestant Christian and spend a decent amount of time reading Scripture and improving my spiritual maturity. 
                I apply a lot of Christine doctrine to my everyday life and continue to ask questions to better my understanding. If you have any questions 
                about the Bible or just want to have a biblical discussion, do not hesitate to talk to me! Here are some of my other interests.
